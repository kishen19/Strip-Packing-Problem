# Strip Packing Problem
Python (3) Implementation of Steinberg's 2-Approximation Algorithm for the Strip Packing Problem

This implementation is based on Steinberg's paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220617577_A_Strip-Packing_Algorithm_with_Absolute_Performance_Bound_2. It is a recursive algorithm which uses one of 7 procedures (as described in the paper) at each step and guarantees an absolute performance bound of 2. Visual of plotting is done with help of matplotlib library of python.
